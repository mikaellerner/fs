== Introduction

The document covers updating from FS _10.0.0_ to the _latest commit_
on its branch. The latest commit is experimental. We make ever effort
to keep the latest commit usable, but any commit that is not tagged
for release is not intended for operations. The intended use of this
document is to collect update information, as it becomes available,
before the next release.

IMPORTANT: Commits that are not tagged for release may have
significant issues including: not building, crashing, and
incompatibilities with operational observation schedule files. Such
commits are intended for testing only. _Let the user beware._

CAUTION: It is expected that those using the latest commit are experts
and will manage the differences for updating to the next official
release themselves. No specific documentation will be provided. What
commit was last updated to will determine what needs to be done.  It
might work to verify that all the steps in the latest version of this
document, appropriately renamed as an update from the old release to
the new release, were completed. An alternate, but not necessarily
complete, approach would be to review the update steps in the new
release to make sure everything has been covered. _Let the user
beware._

This document is up to date with the tagged _10.0.0_ release.  Due to
small increments, such as updating this document, this may not be the
literal last commit, but the differences should be small unless you
happen to `pull` between a significant change and this document being
updated.

== Upgrading from 10.0.0 to the latest commit

You must have already upgraded to _10.0.0_ according to the
<<10.0.0.adoc#,FS 10.0.0 Update Notes>> document before installing
this update.

=== Fetch and make the latest commit

If you are using _git_, as is recommended, then as _prog_
execute:

             cd /usr2/fs-git
             git fetch
             git checkout master
             make clean rmdoto rmexe
             make >& /dev/null
             make -s

No output from the last command indicates a successful _make_.

=== Additional steps

No additional steps are needed at this time.

=== Review changes

Please see the <<Changes since 10.0.0>> section below for details of
