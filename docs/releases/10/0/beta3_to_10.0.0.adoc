== Introduction

The document covers updating from the _beta3_ pre-release to the
FS _10.0.0_.

For instructions for other upgrade paths, see the
<<10.0.0.adoc#_other_update_documents,Other update documents>>
sub-section of the
<<10.0.0.adoc#,FS 10.0.0 Update Notes>> document.

== Upgrading from 10.0.0-beta3 to 10.0.0

You must have already upgraded to _10.0.0-beta3_ according to the
<<beta3.adoc#,FS 10.0.0-beta3 Update Notes>> document before
installing this update.

=== Fetch and make the latest commit

If you are using _git_, as is recommended, then as _prog_
execute:

             cd /usr2/fs-git
             git checkout -q 10.0.0
             git pull
             make clean rmdoto rmexe
             make >& /dev/null
             make -s

No output from the last command indicates a successful _make_.

=== Additional steps

. If you have a station `lo_config` command, you should make sure it
has been updated as described in the
<<10.0.0.adoc#_update_local_lolo_config_commands,Update local lo/lo config commands>>
sub-step of the
<<10.0.0.adoc#_update_station_programs,Update station programs>>
step in the <<10.0.0.adoc#,FS 10.0.0 Update Notes>> document. Although
updating the `lo` command was mentioned for the update to
__10.0.0-beta3__, updating the `lo_config` command was omitted from
some versions of the instructions.

. If you use _metserver_ as a local program and you updated to FS10
from a VGOS branch, you may want to update to the new version. It
includes several improvements, see the <<metserver,metserver>> change
(in the <<FS changes>> sub-section below) for more details. See
_st.default/st-0.0.0/metserver/INSTALL_ for the installation
instructions. 

. If you original updated to FS10 from a VGOS branch version, and
haven't already, you should remove use of the deprecated _be_client_,
_mcicn_, and _udceth0_ scripts with the more general _s_client_
script.
+

You can find instances of the deprecated scripts commands, using,
e.g., for _be_client_:

   cd /usr2/proc
   grep be_client *.prc

+

You can use `less` to identify the SNAP procedures in each file that
uses the script. Use _pfmed_ to make the changes.
+

Information about using _s_client_ can be found using `*help=sy*`.

. If you initially installed a beta version from scratch (and in
particular on FSL10) and are using _bash_ as your shell, you can
change your configuration to prevent the _cd_ command from changing
the `login shell` window title, if you would like. Doing so will keep
the title of this dedicated-use window consistent with the
documentation.
+

To make this change, add the line:

  login_sh*allowTitleOps: false
+

to the `login shell` stanzas of your _~oper/.Xresources_ and
_~prog/.Xresources_ files. See _st.default/~oper/.Xresources_ for an
example. You will need to log-out and log back in again to make the
change fully active.

=== Review changes

Please see the <<Changes since 10.0.0-beta3>> section below
for details of the changes since that pre-release.

== Changes since 10.0.0-beta3

There are separate sub-sections with summaries of changes in the FS
and _drudg_.

Clickable links such as
https://github.com/nvi-inc/fs/issues/36[#36] connect to specific issues
reported at https://github.com/nvi-inc/fs/issues.

A complete history of changes can be found using the `git log` command
from within the FS _git_ archive directory, usually _/usr2/fs-git_.

=== FS changes

. [[makeinc]] Add _make_ commands after `git checkout` in incremental
update notes.

+

For incremental updates it is necessary to clean the old compiled
code. This is due to _drudg_ not participating in the new _Makefile_
scheme, but it is generally cleaner too. Thanks to Carlo Migoni
(Sardinia) for reporting this.

. Add switching to _s_client_ to the update notes.

. [[metserver]] Add instructions for switching to the new _metserver_.
It has several new features for former users of the old VGOS branch
versions:

.. A new command line argument to disable errors messages for specific
sensors if they are broken.

.. Support for `FS_SERIAL_CLOCAL` _make_ time environment variable for
FSL9 and later.

.. Improved reporting of errors when opening serial devices.

.. Reduction in the threshold for old data being declared _stale_ to
10 seconds, which is more than sufficient.

=== drudg changes

There are no changes.
