= FS RDBE Support
Version 0.3 - January 2021

:sectnums:
:toc:

== Introduction

This document covers RDBE rack (the Haystack RDBE-G based on the
Roach-1 board) support in FS _10.0.0_. This support does not provide
the complete command set and functionality usually provided by the FS
for a rack. However, it is sufficient for normal FS for VGOS
observations if the schedule procedure library is provided by a
specially crafted _.skd_ schedule file (see the
<<changes_10.0.0.adoc#broadband,broad band support>> item of the
<<changes_10.0.0.adoc#_drudg_changes_relative_to_the_main_branch,drudg
changes relative to the main branch>> sub-section of the
<<changes_10.0.0.adoc#,Changes from FS9>> document for more details).

== FS RDBE support features

The RDBE features included are:
 
=== Up to four RDBEs are supported

Each RDBE is typically for one frequency band with a different
polarization for that band on each of the two IFs.

.Typical RDBE VGOS configuration
[cols="^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^"]
|=================
| RDBE |Band|Frequency| IF0 pol| IF1 pol| Control File| Control Program| Multi-cast program

|  A   | A  | 3 GHz   |  H     |  V     | _rdbca.ctl_ | _rdbca_        | _rdtca_
|  B   | B  | 5 GHz   |  H     |  V     | _rdbcb.ctl_ | _rdbcb_        | _rdtcb_

|  D   | D  | 10 GHz  |  H     |  V     | _rdbcd.ctl_ | _rdbcd_        | _rdtcd_
|=================

=== Parallel command execution

Parallel execution of commands for multiple RDBEs is supported
(currently the only other device that has this is Mark 6 recorders).
Currently the only parallel RDBE commands are `rdbe` and `rdbe_atten`.

* Multiple instances of devices are identified by the letters,
`a`,`b`, etc. In this case, `a` through `d`.

* Commands that support parallel operation always start with
`_device_` mnemonic, in this case `rdbe`. If a letter for the device,
e.g., `a`, is appended to the command, e.g., `rdbea`, the command
operates only on that device.  If no letter is appended, the command
operates on all active instances of the device.

* By default all available devices are active.  Which devices are
active can be changed with an `active___device__` command, in this
case `active_rdbe`.

* Which devices are available are defined by which have control files
that have non-comment entries. In others words, a device is not
available if its control file is commented out.

* If any errors occur during communication with the devices, they are
all reported. All but the last are reported by the command itself. The
last is returned and reported as the final status of the command.

* Logged responses from the devices may occur in what appears to be
random order. Although communication with devices is initiated in
sequential order, variations in response time can cause the responses
to arrive in a different order. The responses are logged in the order
received.

=== FS RDBE channel labels

FS RDBE channels labels are constructed as `_nnbi_`, where:

* `_nn_` is the channel number `00`-`15`
* `_b_` is the band, `a`, `b`, etc.
* `_i_` is the IF channel: `0` or `1`

For example, `15d0` is band D, IF 0, channel 15.

CAUTION: Channel `0` is not usually a useful channel, being split
between the top and bottom of the band.

=== FS RDBE phase-cal tone labels

FS RDBE phase-cal tone labels are constructed as `_ibnnnn_`, where:

* `_i_` is the IF channel: `0` or `1`
* `_b_` is the band, `a`, `b`, etc.
* `_nnnn_` is tone number in the IF `0001`-`0511` (MHz)

For example, `0d0030` is band D, IF 0, tone 30.

=== Polarization designations.

Polarizations used in _.rxg_ files and the `LO` command are `lcp` or
`rcp` (in _onoff_ output `l` or `r`) regardless of the actual
polarization pair in use. The pairs are: H and V; L and R; and X and
Y. This will be fixed eventually (see
https://github.com/nvi-inc/fs/issues/42[#42]). For now, since there
are are at most two polarizations per receiver, the designations
follow the _alphabetical_ (in English) rule. This is, what matters is
the alphabetical order of the first letter of the names in a
polarization pair. The correction interpretation is determined by
context. Thus:

* `l` (or `lcp`) can represent horizontal linear polarization ("`h`"),
LCP ("`l`"), or "`x`"

* `r` (or `rcp`) can represent vertical linear polarization ("`v`") ,
RCP ("`r`"), or "`y`"

=== Low level RDBE communication command

The `rdbe` command can be used to communicate directly with an
individual RDBE or all active RDBEs in parallel, as described in
the <<Parallel command execution>> sub-section above. A semi-colon is
appended to any string being sent if it not the last character
already. A newline (`0xa`) is also appended.

For full details on the RDBE command set, see the RDBE documentation:

https://www.haystack.mit.edu/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/memo_mark-5_090.1.pdf

Additionally, you can query a single RDBE, say `a`, with:

  rdbea=help?

for some rudimentary information.

=== Attenuation control and monitoring

The `rdbe_atten` command can be used to command or monitor an
individual RDBE or all active RDBEs in parallel, as described the
<<Parallel command execution>> sub-section above. For setting the
attenuation, the default target RMS value is set in the _rdbe.ctl_
control file. That file also specifies the threshold levels for
out-of-range RMS values.

IMPORTANT: Before connecting an input signal to an IF port, the
attenuation for that IF should be set to its maximum value, `31.5`, to
avoid possible damage from from overloading the sampler.

=== Logging of RDBE multicast data

* Multicast messages are generated at a 1 Hz rate by each RDBE. However,
since multicast uses the UDP protocol, fewer messages may be received due
to network congestion and other issues.

* Logged multicast messages from different RDBEs typically occur
interleaved in the log. In order to be able to identify the
originating RDBE, each record is preceded by `\#rdtc__X__#`, where
`_X_` is the band designation of the RDBE, i.e., `a`, `b`, etc.
+

NOTE: There is a separate program to receive multicast messages from each
RDBE. They are named: _rdtca_, _rdtcb_, etc. These names give rise to
the `\#rdtc__X__#` labels.

* For all multicast messages received, the `dot` time, `dot2pps` and
`dot2gps` offsets, and the `sigma` values are logged.

* This logging is controlled by the existing `tpicd` command function
for background logging. Normally for observations logging is toggled
on and off by the `data_valid` command, so there is only logged during
recording.

* Regardless of what channels are being recorded, Tsys is logged for
all channels. Only continuous-cal is supported. The raw counts are
labeled by channel in `tpcont` records. The values are in order of cal
"`on`", then cal "`off`". If a Tcal value is defined for the channel,
the calculated Tsys value is logged in `tsys` records. Overall IF Tsys
values are also logged using two different calculations:

** The `AV` value is the reciprocal of the average of the reciprocals
of the per channel Tsys values (intended to reduce the impact of RFI).

** The `SM` value is calculated from the sum of the "`on`" and "`off`"
over all the channels.

* Phase-cal phase and amplitude are labelled by IF and the MHz of the
tone in the IF, see <<FS RDBE phase-cal tone labels>> for the details.
Only expected tones are logged. The scaling of the amplitude is set by
the _rdbe.ctl_ control file.

=== RDBE monitor display

* A monitor display for the RDBEs is provided as the _monit6_
program.  The display shows information for up four active RDBEs: A,
B, C, and D updating at a 1 Hz rate. Some values are displayed in
inverse to warn of possible problems.  The information displayed is:

** DOT time
** VDIF epoch
+
The value is shown in inverse video if:

.. The values for all RDBEs are different and this value does not agree with the nominal value.
.. The value does not agree with the majority.
+
In case of a tie, the later lettered RDBEs have their values in inverse video.

** `dot2gps`, &mu;s
** `dot2pps`, ns
+
This value is displayed in inverse video if it exceeds the absolute
value threshold specified in _monit6.ctl_.

** RMS, alternating between IF0 and IF1
+
The value is shown in inverse video if it outside the range defined in _rdbe.ctl_.
* Tsys for both IF0 and IF1 displayed for the channel or whole IF value specified in _monit6.ctl_.

** Phase-cal phase and amplitude for the tones selected in _monti6.ctl_, alternating between IF0 and IF1.
+
The amplitude scaling is determined by the setting in _rdbe.ctl_.

* The _monit6_ program has an eponymously named control file
_monit6.ctl_.  This control file is used to adjust the configuration
of the _monit6_ RDBE display. Unlike other FS control files, it is read
each time the _monit6_ program is started. The file has five lines.
The first four control the Tsys and phase-cal display of the four
RDBEs, in order. There are four field on these lines:
+
--
. The channel (`0`-`15`) or whole IF calculation (`avg` or `sum`) to display for the IF0 Teys.
. The channel (`0`-`15`) or whole IF calculation (`avg` or `sum`) to display for the IF0 Teys
. The tone number (`0`-`511`) of the phase-cal tone to display for IF0.
. The tone number (`0`-`511`) of the phase-cal tone to display for IF1.
--
+

The final line specifies the absolute value threshold, in nanoseconds,
for displaying the `dot2pps` in inverse video. Typically, this is set
to `100`.

* Resources for the _monit6_ window were added to _.Xresources_.

=== Pointing and SEFD measurements

The `fivept` and `onoff` command support continuous radiometer using
individual RDBE detectors. A set of individual detectors, or `all`,
can be specified for `onoff`.

NOTE: See `*help=fivept*` and `*help=onoff*` for more information on
using these commands.

=== Time and VDIF epoch setting

The _fmset_ program supports display and setting of RDBE time, one
RDBE at a time.

IMPORTANT: Whenever a RDBE is rebooted, its time _must_ be verified
with _fmset_ and if not correct, set properly.

* The RDBE to be worked with can be selected by entering its letter,
`a`, `b`, etc.

* There are new single character commands: `>` and `<`, to increment
and decrement the VDIF epoch.
+

NOTE: The VDIF epoch increments 0000 UT every January 1 and July 1.
The RDBE does not automatically advance the VDIF epoch it is using.
Ths allows data to be recorded continuously across these epochs with
the same VDIF epoch.
+

IMPORTANT: All RDBEs must be using the same epoch even if it is an old
epoch. Otherwise the Mark 6 recorder will not accept the data.
+

IMPORTANT:  It is recommended that at the first opportunity when not
running a schedule after 0000 UT January 1 and July 1, that _fmset_ be
used to increment the VDIF epochs of all the RDBEs. With this
approach, if one is rebooted for some reason its VDIF epoch will agree
with the others.
+

IMPORTANT: If an RDBE is rebooted after 0000 UT January 1 or July 1
during a schedule that spans one of those epochs, its VDIF will
disagree with the other RDBEs preventing data from being recorded. In
this case, the VDIF for the affected RDBE should be decremented to
agree with the others.

* The `s` command can be used to sync an RDBE:
+

[IMPORTANT]
====

If an RDBE needs to be synced, its data transmission _must_ be turned
before syncing:

  rdbe=dbe_data_send=off;

+
Afterwards it _must_ be turned on again with:

  rdbe=dbe_data_send=on;

+
Failure to do so may corrupt the data.

====

=== Communication control programs

* Each RDBE has its own control program, _rdbca_, _rdbcb_, etc.

* Each control program uses a similarly named control file,
_rdbca.ctl_, _rdbcb.ctl_, etc.
+

These files have one non-comment line, containing three fields:

. The IP or hostname of the device
+

NOTE: For systems where IP addresses and/or hostnames are sensitive
information, it is recommend to use an alias, such _rdbea_ that has
its IP address set in _/etc/hosts_.

. The control port for the device.
+

Usually `5000`.

. The time-out for the device in centiseconds.
+

A value of `100` (one second) is usually suitable for local devices.

=== rdbe.ctl

The values from the file are recorded in the `rdbe` log file header
line each time a log is opened.


NOTE: The values can change each time the FS restarted and  the log is
re-opened.


This file sets the following values on individual lines in this order:

. Target RMS value for setting attenuators, typically `20`.
. Minimum threshold for acceptable RMS values, typically `12`.
. Maximum threshold for acceptable RMS values, typically `28`.
. The scaling to be used for phase-cal amplitudes:
+
--
* `raw` -- detected level (scaled by 1e-7)
* `normalized` --  normalized for the signal level in its channel (and scaled by 1.25e-5)
* `correlator` --  `normalized` corrected by 32 MHz band pass shape
--
+
The `normalized` scaling is the most useful for routine use.

=== Example station procedure library.

An example _station_ library with some useful procedures is provided
in _st.default/proc/rdbestation.prc_
