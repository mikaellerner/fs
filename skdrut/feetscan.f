C  FEETSCAN converts the footage and pass number and
C  puts them into the scan buffer.

C History
!Updates
! 2020-12-30 JMG Removed unused variables
C 970722 nrv New. Removed form newscan and addscan.
C 001101 nrv Put footage field at nch+1 for S2 (as for non-S2).

C Common blocks
      include '../skdrincl/skparm.ftni'
      include '../skdrincl/freqs.ftni'
      include '../skdrincl/statn.ftni'

C Input and Output
      integer*2 ibuf(*)
      integer nch ! character to start with, updated
      integer istn,icod
      integer ipas,ifeet,idrive

C Local
      integer nchx
      integer*2 ibufx(4)

      integer ib2as,ichmv_ch,ichmv

C  Insert the pass number in the scan, then determine
C  whether this is a forward or reverse pass by the
C  evenness or oddness of the pass number.
C  If it's a non-recording scan, set the pass to '0'.

     
      
      NCH = ICHMV_ch(IBUF,NCH+1,"1F")         
C  Put in footage. For S2 this is in seconds.
C  Max length is 5 characters, as set up in newscan.
      nchx=ib2as(ifeet,ibufx,1,5+o'40000'+o'400'*5)
      nch=ichmv(ibuf,nch,ibufx,1,5)
